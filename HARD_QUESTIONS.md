# AgentArgus — HARD_QUESTIONS

Questions a skeptical staff engineer / interviewer would ask about each module.
**Claude Code writes the questions; the owner writes the answers.** A module's
gate does not close until the owner can answer its batch in their own words.

---

## Module 0 — Core (`RunResult`, config, logging)

1. `RunResult` is `frozen=True` and stores collections as tuples — but a `dict`
   *value* nested inside `metadata` is still mutable. Is `RunResult` actually
   immutable? Where exactly does the immutability guarantee stop, and why did you
   choose to stop it there instead of deep-freezing recursively?

2. `with_scores` returns a new object instead of mutating. Prove that this
   actually prevents a class of bug — give a concrete two-evaluator scenario
   where in-place mutation of `scores` would corrupt state, and explain the
   memory cost of the copy-on-write approach when `spans` is large.

3. Trace correlation uses a `contextvars.ContextVar`. What happens to the
   trace_id when work is dispatched to a `ThreadPoolExecutor`? Does the child
   thread see it? What about an `asyncio.create_task`? Prove you know the
   difference and say which one AgentArgus relies on.

4. You chose raw ANSI codes over `colorama`. On an old `cmd.exe` without VT
   processing enabled, what does a colored log line look like? Is that a bug or
   acceptable, and what specifically prevents it from happening in practice?

5. `configure_logging` removes and re-adds handlers on every call. Is that
   thread-safe? What breaks if two modules call it concurrently at import time,
   and why is (or isn't) that a real risk?

6. The `Judge` protocol has a single synchronous `complete(prompt) -> str`
   method. RAG metrics may need to fire many judge calls per dataset row. Does a
   sync-only judge interface bottleneck batch eval? How would you add concurrency
   later without breaking the protocol's existing implementers?

7. `to_dict`/`from_dict` is a hand-written round-trip. `output` and tool
   `result` are typed `Any`. What happens when `output` is a non-JSON-serializable
   object (e.g. a numpy array or a custom class)? Where does that fail, and is
   failing there the right call?

8. Why is `RunResult` the single coupling point for the whole system? Defend it
   against the alternative where each module (tracer, cost, eval) defines its own
   result shape. What is the cost of this central aggregate when a future module
   needs a field none of the others care about?

9. `AgentArgusConfig.from_env` silently falls back to defaults on a malformed
   `AGENTARGUS_COST_CEILING_USD`. Is silent fallback the right behaviour for a
   *cost ceiling* — a safety limit? Argue both sides.

10. `slots=True` on the dataclasses — what did that buy you, and what did it cost
    you (think: pickling, multiple inheritance, adding attributes in
    `__post_init__` via `object.__setattr__`)? Why does `object.__setattr__`
    still work with slots + frozen?
